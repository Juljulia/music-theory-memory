## Code Review 
by Maja Alin
- `script.js` - Good comments, it makes it easier to read code!
- `script.js` - But the code might have been even more readable if you split the functions into different files.
- `script.js:1` - Maybe you should use Camel case on memorycards to make it uniform.
- `script.js:25` - Same thing on memoryboard.
